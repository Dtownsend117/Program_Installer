# Program_Installer
Installs programs from a directory either individually or one at a time
You must install all imports through pip before using this (check line 1 in code)
You will need to have the EXE files in the directory for this to work
Although you may already have the software you want installed, this is still a good project for setting up new computers 

NOTE!!:
There is only support for EXE files
You will need to click the options for install, this just starts the process



You are welcome to edit the code, add it to a project, and even turn it into its own standalone program to make the process more efficient
